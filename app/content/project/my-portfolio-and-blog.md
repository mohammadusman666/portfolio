# Project Introduction: Developer Portfolio & Blog

## 1. Project Objective
The Developer Portfolio and Blog project aims to create a personal online space where developers can showcase their skills, projects, and experiences while sharing knowledge and insights through a blog. It serves as a platform to promote personal branding and expertise in programming.

## 2. Technologies Used

- **Nuxt 3**: Built on Vue.js, Nuxt 3 is a powerful framework that allows the creation of high-performance web applications. With its support for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), the portfolio and blog load faster, are more SEO-friendly, and offer a smooth user experience.
  
- **TailwindCSS**: This utility-first CSS framework helps streamline the process of building a responsive and modern user interface. With Tailwind, you can quickly customize the design without writing extensive custom CSS, making the UI clean, modern, and highly responsive across devices.

## 3. Key Features

- **Personal Portfolio Page**: This section provides a detailed introduction about the developer, including their skills, educational background, and work experience. Highlighted projects are displayed in an attractive card layout, with links to live demos and source code (if available).

- **Project Showcase**: Each project is showcased with relevant technologies, descriptive images, and a brief overview of its functionality. Users can click for a deeper dive into each project’s development process.

- **Blog for Knowledge Sharing**: The integrated blog allows developers to write and share articles on various programming topics, tech trends, and tips & tricks in web development. Readers can easily search for and browse posts by category.

- **Responsive Design**: The design is fully responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across all platforms.
